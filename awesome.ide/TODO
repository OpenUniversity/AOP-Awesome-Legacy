Next:
- Refactor! the code works but there is plenty of balagan. go over the code
of the wizards and see where to improve. before that, think what abstractions
are natural based on the experience gained.
- Testing! at least acceptance.
- Before the conference we must implement in multi-mech proj:
	- create spec/ with all the manifests and with composition.spec
	- the user adds a key-value for advice ordering and hit generate.
	=> a configuring aspect is generated.
	Think this is in the highest priority.
